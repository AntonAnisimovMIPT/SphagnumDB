# SphagnumDB

**SphagnumDB** is a minimalist, decentralized key-value database built on a network of lightweight nodes connected via **libp2p**. Like sphagnum moss, it's resilient, low-maintenance, and thrives in harsh conditions where others fail.

## **Philosophy**

* **Simplicity ≠ primitiveness:** Simple and intuitive API, but thoughtful architecture.
* **Decentralization like moss:** No master nodes — just a peer-to-peer mat.
* **Unpretentiousness **to** the **environment**:** Must meet the minimum system requirements.
